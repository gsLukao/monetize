This Python script enables automated anonymous browsing using Chrome or Chromium in conjunction with the Tor service. It processes multiple links from a text file, ensuring each link is accessed from a different IP address generated by Tor.

### Key Features:
- **Anonymous Browsing**: Utilizes Tor to ensure anonymity while browsing URLs.
- **Automatic IP Rotation**: Restarts the Tor service for a new IP with each request.
- **Header Storage**: Saves request headers for each IP used, allowing for future reuse.
- **Multiple Link Processing**: Supports processing a list of URLs from a text file.
- **Automatic Consent Handling**: Detects and accepts consent pages automatically, such as YouTube's.
- **Video Handling**: Waits for video playback on loaded pages.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- Selenium WebDriver
- Tor service installed and running
- Chrome or Chromium with the appropriate ChromeDriver

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies, preferably in a virtual environment.
3. Ensure the Tor service is running.

### Usage:
- **Single Link**: Open a single URL using Tor and Chrome/Chromium.
- **Multiple Links**: Process a list of URLs from a text file with automatic IP rotation.

### Logs and Headers:
- IPs used are logged in `ips.log`.
- Request headers are saved as JSON files in the `headers` directory.

### Contribution:
Contributions are welcome!
